Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
 
CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/

users can visit our site anonymously;
 
our Privacy Policy link includes the word “Privacy”, and can easily be found on the page specified above on the home page of our website;
 
users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;
 
users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at matthew.mcneely@gmail.com.

You can enable or disable Do Not Track by visiting the Preferences or Settings page of your web browser.
